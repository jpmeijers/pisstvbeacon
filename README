Raspberry Pi SSTV beacon
========================

This folder contains a few scripts and a program to:
1. Capture an image from an Ubiquity IP camera (AircamDownload.py)
2. Converts the jpeg image to a wav file, Martin1 encoded (sstvtx.c)
3. Automate the capture, resize, overlay, encode and playback of the wav file (transmitImage.sh)


Required programs
=================

Python 2.7 to execute AircamDownload.py
Imagemagick convert to resize and overlay the image
aplay to play back the wav files


How to build
============

Except for sstvtx.c, the rest of this folder only contains scripts that can be runAll 
without compilation. To compile sstvtx.c on a Raspberry Pi, I used the following 
command:
    gcc sstvtx.c -o sstvtx -ljpeg -lsndfile
